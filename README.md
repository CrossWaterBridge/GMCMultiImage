# GMCMultiImage

GMCMultiImage is a set of classes you can use to show pictures for which you have multiple images in a range of sizes.

For example, you can use `GMCZoomingMultiImageView` to present a picture that the user can pan and zoom. It automatically downloads (or loads from cache) the appropriately sized image for each zoom level.
